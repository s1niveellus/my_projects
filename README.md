 Featured Projects

[RRM-Simulation](https://github.com/Arista-HP/RRM-Simulation) & [Sensing_Orchestrator](https://github.com/Arista-HP/Sensing_Orchestrator)

 Silver Medal @ Inter IIT Tech Meet 14.0 (Arista Networks)
 A safety-first WiFi optimization pipeline designed to manage radio resources in high-density environments.
 Tech: Python, Deep Q-Learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNN),CNNs, NetworkX.
 Implemented Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Gamma-Thompson Sampling to safely explore channel configurations without disrupting live network traffic.
 Orchestration:Built a sensing pipeline that continuously updates the RL agent with real-time interference data.
