# Projects

A collection of major projects focusing on Network Optimization, Embedded Security, and Generative AI.

## RRM-Simulation & Sensing_Orchestrator
**Silver Medal, Inter IIT Tech Meet 14.0 (Arista Networks)**

A safety-first WiFi optimization pipeline designed to manage radio resources in high-density environments.

* **Tech:** Python, Deep Q-Learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), CNNs, NetworkX.
* **Optimization:** Implemented Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Gamma-Thompson Sampling to safely explore channel configurations without disrupting live network traffic.
* **Orchestration:** Built a sensing pipeline that continuously updates the RL agent with real-time interference data.
